First, go to the top of the repo (on the `master` branch) and click on code > codespaces > create codespace
now you have your own free server instance to host eaglercraft. Next you need to run the setup commands:

'chmod -x ./start.sh' and './start sh' 
## ⚠ MOST IMPORTANT! ⚠
Copy the 8081 port address and it should be like, for example, `https://eagtek-files-392jejdw-8081.app.github.dev` . Copy this and paste it in your ⚠⚠⚠ browser BUT DONT,  ⚠⚠⚠⚠ DO NOT PRESS `ENTER` YET!⚠⚠⚠⚠ Instead, replace the `https` (in the beginning of the port address) and replace it with a `wss` . Here is some examples:
❌ WRONG: `https://eagtek-files-392jejdw-8081.app.github.dev`
✅ CORRECT: `wss://eagtek-files-392jejdw-8081.app.github.dev`
This will be your server address! Like Minecraft, you can go to the servers, clicking add server, and pasting the address of the server, but we are talking about eaglecraft. If you have a Website that has eaglecraft already on it, feel free to use that. If you don't, and you wanna look smart at ur school then no worries, you can host your own website at [This repository.]()
